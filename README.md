## Overview
**Retailers in COVID** is a course project in my first semester of the MSBA program at UMN. 
Since COVID-19 brought so much uncertainty in retail traffic, the retailers need to allocate their resources more wisely.
To help visualize the impact of COVID-19 on the retail industry, my team built this [R-Shiny dashboard](https://xinbo-wang.shinyapps.io/Retailers-in-COVID/) 
utilizing the data from [Google Mobility](https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility).



## Content
The repository contains three core files.
### mobility_data_fetching_preparing.R
This is the R script that fetches the data from the Google platform and makes transformations to output the data for our dashboard.

### data_for_dashboard.csv
This is the data output by the script and to be visualized in the R Markdown file.

### Retailers-in-COVID.Rmd
This is the R Markdown file that can be knitted to form the R-Shiny dashboard shown in the link [R-Shiny dashboard](https://xinbo-wang.shinyapps.io/Retailers-in-COVID/) 

## How to Use the Dashboard
The green spots on the maps represent the counties that have increased traffic in retailer stores and red spots are ones with decreased traffic, compared to pre-COVID. 
The size of the spots represents a change in percentage (larger spots = larger change).

As you can see, the map is crowded by spots (counties). To make it easier to read, we built several widgets that can filter data.
### Filter by State

## Conclusion
Using our dashboard, retailers can allocate resources smartly according to retail traffic, especially in a time like COVID.
